The XPointer framework is one of those W3C notions that is dead
today. Same with the TEI XPointer schemes. The cause of dead is
manifold and ranges from a lack of implementations to weaknesses of
the specification: It is unclear, what a processor is to do with the
pointers, that actually only point to a portion of a resource. As a
consequence, XPointers have never grown to a paradigmatic field of
application, in which they could have proven their value. However,
there is such a paradigmatic field of application for the TEI XPointer
schemes: the Web-Annotations-like <annotation> element and its @target
attribute. If this element is really meant to "represent[] an
annotation following the Web Annotation Data Model", like the TEI
reference states, then we need a referencing mechanism, that is
compatible with the Web Annotation's selector mechanism, and that at a
specification level.  The TEI XPointer schemes not only do satisfy
this requirement, but are the only specified component of the TEI,
that satisfies it. The paper first introduces a full
implementation. It then showcases an application in an inquiry on
intertextuality using the <annotation> element: The semantic deferrals
in the textual tradition of the book of Ijob, originating from the
translations of the Masoretic Text to Septuagint and Targum.
